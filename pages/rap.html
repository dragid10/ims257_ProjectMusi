                <p class="lead">Hip hop music, also called hip-hopor rap music, is a music genre developed in the United States by inner-city
                    African Americans in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies
                    rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted.</p>

                <p>It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping,
                    DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling
                    beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing. While often
                    used to refer solely to rapping, "hip hop" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture.The
                    term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music,though rapping is not a required
                    component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including
                    DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.</p>

                <p>Hip hop as both a musical genre and a culture was formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly
                    popular in New York City, particularly among African-American youth residing in the Bronx. At block parties
                    DJs played percussive breaks of popular songs using two turntables and a DJ mixer to be able to play
                    breaks from two copies of the same record, alternating from one to the other and extending the "break".
                    Hip hop's early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum machines became widely available and
                    affordable. Turntablist techniques such as scratching and beatmatching developed along with the breaks
                    and Jamaican toasting, a chanting vocal style, was used over the beats. Rapping developed as a vocal
                    style in which the artist speaks or chants along rhythmically with an instrumental or synthesized beat.
                    Notable artists at this time include DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five, Fab Five Freddy,
                    Marley Marl, Afrika Bambaataa, Kool Moe Dee, Kurtis Blow, Doug E. Fresh, Whodini, Warp 9, The Fat Boys,
                    and Spoonie Gee. The Sugarhill Gang's 1979 song "Rapper's Delight" is widely regarded to be the first
                    hip hop record to gain widespread popularity in the mainstream.The 1980s marked the diversification of
                    hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles. Prior to the 1980s, hip hop music was largely confined
                    within the United States. However, during the 1980s, it began to spread to music scenes in dozens of
                    countries, many of which mixed hip hop with local styles to create new subgenres.</p>
